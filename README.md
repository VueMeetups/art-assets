# Vue.js Meetup Art Assets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VueMeetups/art-assets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VueMeetups/art-assets)

Reusable art assets for Vue meetups.

Due to the large size of art assets and the limitations of free GitHub accounts, we are storing the art assets in a Google Drive:

* https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1ovWdH4ntFvUXNTRVB2MG1odWc

* * *

## Contributing art assets:

Create [an issue](https://github.com/VueMeetups/art-assets/issues/new) with your gmail and the Vue group you represent in it and I'll add you to the Google Shared Drive to update/maintain your assets.
